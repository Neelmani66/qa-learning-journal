 Update: Based on professional feedback, Iâ€™m pausing this manual testing journey and restructuring my learning path.

 A new repo/folder will be created focused only on core manual testing, with deep dives into regression and unit testing â€” skipping advanced types like security/sanity for now as they require real-world experience.

# QA Learning Journal ðŸ§ªðŸ“˜

Welcome to my learning journal as I explore the world of **Software Testing** â€” from **Manual Testing** fundamentals to **Automation Testing** using **Java** and tools like Selenium.

This repo is a personal roadmap, filled with notes, code samples, and practice projects as I build my skills toward becoming a QA Engineer.
