# QA Learning Journal ðŸ§ªðŸ“˜

Welcome to my learning journal as I explore the world of **Software Testing** â€” from **Manual Testing** fundamentals to **Automation Testing** using **Java** and tools like Selenium.

This repo is a personal roadmap, filled with notes, code samples, and practice projects as I build my skills toward becoming a QA Engineer.
