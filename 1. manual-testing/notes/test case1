IN THIS JOURNAL WE WILL TALK ABOUT TEST CASES AND HOW TO WRITE THEM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A test case is a set of steps or actions performed on a system to check if it meets the software requirements and works as expected.
It helps verify whether the system functions correctly under different conditions and meets to the expectations.
Test cases are essential for identifying issues and ensuring the software performs as intended.

PARAMETERS FOR TEST CASES :

1. Module Name: Subject or title that defines the functionality of the test.

2. Test Case Id: A unique identifier assigned to every single condition in a test case

3. Tester Name: The name of the person who would be carrying out the test.

4. Test scenario: The test scenario provides a brief description to the tester, as in providing a small overview to know about what needs to be performed and the small features, and components of the test.

5. Test Case Description: The condition required to be checked for a given software.
for eg. Check if only numbers validation is working or not for an age input box.

6. Test Steps: Steps to be performed for the checking of the condition.

7. Prerequisite: The conditions required to be fulfilled before the start of the test process.

8. Test Priority: As the name suggests gives priority to the test cases that had to be performed first, or are more important and that could be performed later.

9. Test Data: The inputs to be taken while checking for the conditions.

10. Test Expected Result: The output which should be expected at the end of the test.

11. Test parameters: Parameters assigned to a particular test case.

12. Actual Result: The output that is displayed at the end.

13. Environment Information: The environment in which the test is being performed, such as the operating system, security information, the software name, software version, etc.

14. Status: The status of tests such as pass, fail, NA, etc.

15. Comments: Remarks on the test regarding the test for the betterment of the software.

When do we Write Test Cases?


Before development: Test cases could be written before the actual coding as that would help to identify the requirement of the product/software and carry out the test later when the product/software gets developed.

After development: Test cases are also written directly after coming up with a product/software or after developing the feature but before the launching of a product/software as needed to test the working of that particular feature.

During development: Test cases are sometimes written during the development time, parallelly.
so whenever a part of the module/software gets developed it gets tested as well.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Write Test Cases?

1. To check whether the software meets customer expectations: Test cases help to check if a particular module/software is meeting the specified requirement or not.

2. To check software consistency with conditions: Test cases determine if a particular module/software works with a given set of conditions.

3. Narrow down software updates: Test cases help to narrow down the software needs and required updates.

4. Better test coverage: Test cases help to make sure that all possible scenarios are covered and documented.

5. For consistency in test execution: Test cases help to maintain consistency in test execution.
A well-documented test case helps the tester to just have a look at the test case and start testing the application.

6. Helpful during maintenance: Test cases are detailed which makes them helpful during the maintenance phase.

TEST TEMPLATE

A Test Case Template is a simple, organized format used in software testing to create test cases.
It helps ensure that all tests are written clearly and consistently.

Test Case ID -	Each test case should have a unique ID.

Test Case Description -	Each test case should have a proper description to let testers know what the test case is about.

Pre-Conditions -	Conditions that are required to be satisfied before executing the test case.

Test Steps -	Mention all test steps in detail and to be executed from the end-userâ€™s perspective.

Test Data -	Test data could be used as input for the test cases.

Expected Result -	The result is expected after executing the test cases.

Post Condition -	Conditions need to be fulfilled when the test cases are successfully executed.

Actual Result -	The result that which system shows once the test case is executed.

Status	- Set the status as Pass or Fail on the expected result against the actual result.

Project Name -	Name of the project to which the test case belongs.

Module Name	- Name of the module to which the test case belongs.

Reference Document -	Mention the path of the reference document.

Created By -	Name of the tester who created the test cases.

Date of Creation -	Date of creation of test cases.

Reviewed By -	Name of the tester who reviews the test case.

Date of Review	- When the test cases were reviewed.

Executed By -	Name of the tester who executed the test case.

Date of Execution -	Date when the test cases were executed.

Comments	- Include comments which help the team to understand the test cases.
