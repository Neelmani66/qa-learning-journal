# INTRODUCTION TO MANUAL TESTING #
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Manual testing is a technique to test the software that is carried out using the functions and features of an application. 
In manual software testing, a tester tests the software by following predefined test cases. 
In this testing, testers make test cases for the codes, test the software, and give the final report about that software. 
Manual testing is time-consuming because it is done by humans, and there is a chance of human errors.

Every new application must be manually tested before its testing can be automated. 
Manual Testing requires more effort than automation testing but is necessary to check automation feasibility.
There is no requirement for knowledge of any testing tool in manual testing.

# TYPES OF MANUAL TESTING #
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
There are different methods to implement manual testing, but it is broadly classified into three types of manual testing:

1. WHITE BOX TESTING
2. BLACK BOX TESTING
3. GREY BOX TESTING

# STEPS OF MANUAL TESTING #
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Manual testing can be done in 6 steps :

Step 1. Requirement Analysis: Study the software project documentation, guides, and Application Under Test (AUT). Analyze the requirements from SRS.
Step 2. Test Plan Creation: Create a test plan covering all the requirements.
Step 3. Test Case Creation: Design the test cases that cover all the requirements described in the documentation.
Step 4. Test Case Execution: Review and baseline the test cases with the team lead and client. Execute the test cases on the application under test.
Step 5. Defect Logging: Detect the bugs, log and report them to the developers.
Step 6. Defect Fix and Re-verification: When bugs are fixed, again execute the failing test cases to verify they pass.

# NOW LETS TALK ABOUT ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTEGES OF MANUAL TESTING #
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

ADVANTAGES ::
1. Fast and accurate visual feedback: It detects almost every bug in the software application and is used to test the dynamically changing GUI designs like layout, text, etc.
2. Less expensive: It is less expensive as it does not require any high-level skill or a specific type of tool.
3. No coding is required: No programming knowledge is required while using the black box testing method. It is easy to learn for the new testers.
4. Efficient for unplanned changes: Manual testing is suitable in case of unplanned changes to the application, as it can be adopted easily.

DISADVANTAGES ::
1. Less reliable: Manual testing is less reliable as it does not provide testing on all aspects of testing.
2. Can not be reused: There is a need to develop separate test cases for each new software.
3. Large human resources required: Manual testing requires numerous human resources, and there are some tasks that canâ€™t be performed manually.
4. Needs experience: The tester needs to know the application well. They develop test cases based on their experience, there is no proof that all the functions are covered or not.
5. Time-consuming: If the project is large, then the testing process is time-consuming.
