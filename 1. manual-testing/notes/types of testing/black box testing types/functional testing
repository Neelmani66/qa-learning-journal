1. FUNCTIONAL TESTING :

WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL TESTING?
Functional testing is defined as a type of testing that verifies that each function of the software application works in conformance with the requirement and specification. 
This testing is not concerned with the source code of the application. 
Each functionality of the software application is tested by providing appropriate test input, expecting the output, and comparing the actual output with the expected output. 
This testing focuses on checking the user interface, APIs, database, security, client or server application, and functionality of the Application Under Test.
Functional testing can be manual or automated.


//// PURPOSE OF FUNCTIONAL TESTING ////

1. Test each function of the application: Functional testing tests each function of the application by providing the appropriate input and verifying the output against the functional requirements of the application.
2. Test primary entry function: In functional testing, the tester tests each entry function of the application to check all the entry and exit points.
3. Test flow of the GUI screen: In functional testing, the flow of the GUI screen is checked so that the user can navigate throughout the application.

//// WHAT TO TEST ////

1. Basic Usability: This checks if users can easily navigate the app without any trouble. It’s all about making sure the experience is smooth.
2. Main Functions: Functional testing also looks at the app is a core features to verify they are working correctly, just as they’re meant to.
3. Accessibility: This ensures the app is accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities. It checks whether accessibility features are in place and functioning properly.
4. Error Handling: Lastly, it tests how the app handles errors. Are the right error messages shown when something goes wrong? This part verify users are informed when an issue arises.

NOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS ::

Step 1. Identify test input: This step involves identifying the functionality that needs to be tested. This can vary from testing the usability functions, and main functions to error conditions.

Step 2. Compute expected outcomes: Create input data based on the specifications of the function and determine the output based on these specifications.

Step 3. Execute test cases: This step involves executing the designed test cases and recording the output.

Step 4. Compare the actual and expected output: In this step, the actual output obtained after executing the test cases is compared with the expected output to determine the amount of deviation in the results.
This step reveals if the system is working as expected or not.

//// BENEFITS OF FUNCTIONAL TESTING ////

1. Bug-free product: Functional testing ensures the delivery of a bug-free and high-quality product.
2. Customer satisfaction: It ensures that all requirements are met and ensures that the customer is satisfied.
3. Testing focused on specifications: Functional testing is focused on specifications as per customer usage.
4. Proper working of application: This ensures that the application works as expected and ensures proper working of all the functionality of the application.
5. Improves quality of the product: Functional testing ensures the security and safety of the product and improves the quality of the product.
