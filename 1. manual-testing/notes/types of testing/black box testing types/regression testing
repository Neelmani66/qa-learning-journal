## THIS IS 2ND TYPE OF BLACK BOX TESTING ##

Regression testing is a crucial aspect of software engineering that ensures the stability and reliability of a software product.
It involves retesting the previously tested functionalities to verify that recent code changes havenâ€™t adversely affected the existing features.

By identifying and fixing any regression or unintended bugs, regression testing helps maintain the overall quality of the software. 
This process is essential for software development teams to deliver consistent and high-quality products to their users.

When to do regression testing?

When new functionality is added to the system and the code has been modified to absorb and integrate that functionality with the existing code.
When some defect has been identified in the software and the code is debugged to fix it.
When the code is modified to optimize its working.

Process of regression testing ::

program failure---> debugging---> identification of bugs---> modification of source code---> select testcase for modified code---> execute test case

Advantages of Regression Testing ::

Automated unit testing
Comprehensive test coverage
System integration
Faster test execution completion
Improved developer productivity
Parallel testing
Reduced costs
Regression testing improves product quality
Reusability
Scalability
Time efficiency

Disadvantages of Regression Testing::

It can be time and resource-consuming if automated tools are not used.
It is required even after very small changes in the code.
Time and Resource Constraints.
Among the significant risks associated with regression testing are the time and resources required to perform it.
Incomplete or Insufficient Test Coverage.
False Positives and False Negatives.
Test Data Management Challenges.
