BLACK BOX --- BX
WHITE BOX --- WX
GREY BOX --- GX


Available Information :

BX --- Tester has no knowledge of the internal workings including source code and architecture. 
WX --- Focuses on inputs and outputs.	Tester has full knowledge of internal workings, including source code and architecture.
GX --- Tester has partial knowledge, such as access to design documents but not the source code.

Test Coverage :

BX ---Limited coverage, based on expected behavior and requirements without internal knowledge.
WX --- Full coverage, as tester has access to source code and can test all code paths.	
GX --- Moderate coverage, with focus on areas where some knowledge is available.

Time of AnalysiS :

BX --- Performed after the application is built, during later stages of the SDLC.	
WX --- Can be performed early in the SDLC, integrating into the development process.
GX --- Performed after some parts of the application are built but allows for earlier analysis than black box testing.

Tool Usage	:

BX --- Uses dynamic analysis tools for testing during runtime, focusing on user behavior.
WX --- Uses static analysis tools (like code analyzers) to inspect source code.	
GX --- Uses both dynamic and limited static analysis tools depending on available knowledge.

Tester Mindset :

BX --- Acts as an end user, focusing on functionality without knowledge of internal workings.	
WX --- Acts like a developer, focusing on internal logic, structure, and code.	
GX --- Partially a developer and user, focusing on the expected behavior with some internal knowledge.

Test Case Input Size	:

BX --- Largest, as it needs to cover broad user interactions and scenarios.
WX --- Smaller compared to black box, as it focuses on specific code paths.	
GX --- Smaller than both black and white box, focused on available knowledge areas.

Finding Hidden Errors :

BX --- Difficult to detect, as it focuses only on outputs.
WX --- Easier due to full access to internal code and logic.	
GX --- Challenging, may find some hidden errors that are visible at the user level.

Algorithm Testing	:

BX --- Not suitable, as it lacks the internal access to algorithms.
WX --- Well-suited for testing internal algorithms and logic.
GX --- Not suitable, as it lacks full access to algorithms and internal code.

Other Names	:

BX --- Functional testing, data-driven testing, closed box testing.	
WX --- Structural testing, clear box testing, code-based testing, transparent testing.	
GX --- Translucent testing.
