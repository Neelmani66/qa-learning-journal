## WHITH THIS WE START NEW TOPIC ABOUT WHITE BOX TESTING ##

WHAT IS WHITE BOX TESTING?
White box testing is a Software Testing Technique that involves testing the internal structure and workings of a Software Application. 
The tester has access to the source code and uses this knowledge to design test cases that can verify the correctness of the software at the code level.

White box testing is also known as Structural Testing or Code-based Testing, and it is used to test the software’s internal logic, flow, and structure.
The tester creates test cases to examine the code paths and logic flows to ensure they meet the specified requirements.

WHAT DOES WHITE BOX TESTING FOCUS ON?
......................................................................................................................................................................
1. PATH TESTING
......................................................................................................................................................................
Path Testing is a method that is used to design the test cases. In the path testing method, the control flow graph of a program is designed to find a set of linearly independent paths of execution.
In this method, Cyclomatic Complexity is used to determine the number of linearly independent paths and then test cases are generated for each path. 

It gives complete branch coverage but achieves that without covering all possible paths of the control flow graph.
McCabe’s Cyclomatic Complexity is used in path testing. It is a structural testing method that uses the source code of a program to find every possible executable path. 

Advantages of Path Testing ::

1. The path testing method reduces the redundant tests.
2. Path testing focuses on the logic of the programs.
3. Path testing is used in test case design.

Disadvantages of Path Testing ::

1. A tester needs to have a good understanding of programming knowledge or code knowledge to execute the tests.
2. The test case increases when the code complexity is increased.
3. It will be difficult to create a test path if the application has a high complexity of code.
4. Some test paths may skip some of the conditions in the code. It may not cover some conditions or scenarios if there is an error in the specific paths.

2. INPUT AND OUTPUT VALIDATION
......................................................................................................................................................................
By providing different inputs to a function, white box testing check the the function gives the correct output each of the time.
This helps to confirm that the software consistently produces the required results under various conditions.
......................................................................................................................................................................
3. SECURITY TESTING
......................................................................................................................................................................
Security Testing is a type of Software Testing that uncovers vulnerabilities in the system and determines that the data and resources of the system are protected from possible intruders.
It ensures that the software system and application are free from any threats or risks that can cause a loss.
Security testing of any system is focused on finding all possible loopholes and weaknesses of the system that might result in the loss of information or repute of the organization.

Advantages of Security Testing ::

1. Identifying vulnerabilities: Security testing helps identify vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by attackers, such as weak passwords, unpatched software, and misconfigured systems.
2. Improving system security: Security testing helps improve the overall security of the system by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities and potential threats.
3. Ensuring compliance: Security testing helps ensure that the system meets relevant security standards and regulations, such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and SOC2.
4. Reducing risk: By identifying and fixing vulnerabilities and potential threats before the system is deployed to production, security testing helps reduce the risk of a security incident occurring in a production environment.
5. Improving incident response: Security testing helps organizations understand the potential risks and vulnerabilities that they face, enabling them to prepare for and respond to potential security incidents.

Disadvantages of Security Testing ::

1. Resource-intensive: Security testing can be resource-intensive, requiring significant hardware and software resources to simulate different types of attacks.
2. Complexity: Security testing can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and expertise to set up and execute effectively.
3. Limited testing scope: Security testing may not be able to identify all types of vulnerabilities and threats.
4. False positives and negatives: Security testing may produce false positives or false negatives, which can lead to confusion and wasted effort.
5. Time-consuming: Security testing can be time-consuming, especially if the system is large and complex.
6. Difficulty in simulating real-world attacks: It’s difficult to simulate real-world attacks, and it’s hard to predict how attackers will interact with the system.

4. LOOP SOFTWARE TESTING
......................................................................................................................................................................
Loop Testing is a type of software testing type that is performed to validate the loops.
It is one of the type of Control Structure Testing. Loop testing is a white box testing technique and is used to test loops in the program.

Objectives of Loop Testing:
The objective of Loop Testing is:

To fix the infinite loop repetition problem.
To know the performance.
To identify the loop initialization problems.
To determine the uninitialized variables.

Advantages of Loop Testing ::

1. Loop testing limits the number of iterations of loop.
2. Loop testing ensures that program doesn’t go into infinite loop process.
3. Loop testing endures initialization of every used variable inside the loop.
4. Loop testing helps in identification of different problems inside the loop.
5. Loop testing helps in determination of capacity.

Disadvantages of Loop Testing:

1. Loop testing is mostly effective in bug detection in low-level software.
2. Loop testing is not useful in bug detection.

5. DATA FLOWING TESTING
......................................................................................................................................................................
Data Flow Testing is a type of structural testing .
It is a method that is used to find the test paths of a program according to the locations of definitions and uses of variables in the program. 
It has nothing to do with data flow diagrams. Furthermore, it is concerned with:

Statements where variables receive values,
Statements where these values are used or referenced.

By analyzing control flow graphs, this technique aims to identify issues such as unused variables or incorrect definitions, ensuring proper handling of data within the code.
To gain a deeper understanding of Data Flow Testing and enhance your testing skills

Advantages of Data Flow Testing ::

1. To find a variable that is used but never defined,
2. To find a variable that is defined but never used,
3. To find a variable that is defined multiple times before it is use,
4. Deallocating a variable before it is used.

Disadvantages of Data Flow Testing ::

1. Time consuming and costly process
2. Requires knowledge of programming languages
